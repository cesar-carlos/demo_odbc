# Cursor Rules

This folder contains **Project Rules** for Cursor, which are automatically applied when working on project files. The rules provide persistent context for the AI, ensuring code consistency and quality.

## How They Work

Rules are `.mdc` (Markdown Cursor) files that contain:

- **Frontmatter YAML**: Metadata about the rule
  - `description`: Brief description of the rule
  - `globs`: File patterns to which the rule applies
  - `alwaysApply`: Defines whether the rule should always be applied

- **Markdown Content**: The rules and guidelines themselves

## Important Behavioral Rules

### Commits and Documentation

- ❌ **NEVER make git commits** unless explicitly requested by the user
- ❌ **NEVER create documentation** (README.md, comments, etc.) unless explicitly requested
- ❌ **NEVER push to repository** unless explicitly requested
- ✅ **ONLY commit/push/document** when the user explicitly asks for it
- ✅ Always ask for confirmation before committing or pushing changes
- ✅ Code should be self-explanatory through clear naming

These rules ensure that the AI assistant respects user control over version control and documentation decisions.

## Available Rules

### Generic Rules (Reusable Across Projects)

#### 1. `architecture.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`

Clean Architecture overview and principles:
- Clean Architecture principles
- Layer structure (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation)
- Dependency rules between layers
- When to use Clean Architecture
- Benefits of Clean Architecture

**Use**: General architectural guidance for any Flutter/Dart project using Clean Architecture.

#### 2. `clean_architecture.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`

Clean Architecture dependency rules:
- Dependency rules between layers
- Import rules for each layer
- Verification checklist
- Examples of correct/incorrect imports

**Use**: Enforce dependency rules in Clean Architecture projects.

#### 3. `solid_principles.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`

SOLID principles detailed guide:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Examples for each principle
- Common violations

**Use**: Ensure SOLID compliance in code design.

#### 4. `coding_style.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`, `test/**/*.dart`

Dart style guide (2026 updated):
- Naming conventions (Effective Dart 2026)
- Import organization
- Types and null safety
- Const and final usage
- Functions and methods
- Classes and constructors
- Dot shorthands
- Formatting guidelines
- Tear-off for widgets
- Line length recommendations
- Use of dart format

**Use**: Maintain consistent Dart coding style based on latest Effective Dart guidelines.

#### 5. `coding_conventions.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`

Coding conventions and patterns:
- Naming for classes, methods, variables, files
- Use case structure
- Repository interface and implementation
- Error handling with result_dart
- Dependency injection patterns
- Import organization
- Document only when requested

**Use**: General coding patterns and conventions for any Dart project.

#### 6. `null_safety.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`

Null safety best practices:
- Nullable/non-nullable type declaration
- Variable initialization
- Null checks and null-aware operators
- Nullable collections
- Functions and methods with null safety
- External APIs and JSON parsing
- Validation and documentation

**Use**: Ensure proper null safety usage throughout the codebase.

#### 7. `testing.mdc`

**Applied to**: `test/**/*.dart`

Testing patterns and best practices:
- Unit test structure
- Widget tests
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test naming conventions
- Isolation and mocking
- Coverage recommendations

**Use**: Write clean, maintainable tests with proper structure.

#### 8. `flutter_widgets.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/presentation/**/*.dart`, `lib/shared/**/*.dart`

Flutter widgets best practices:
- Stateless vs StatefulWidget
- Performance and optimization
- Const widgets
- Widget composition
- Layout and responsive design
- Theming and navigation
- State management

**Use**: Build efficient, reusable Flutter widgets with best practices.

#### 9. `general_rules.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`, `test/**/*.dart`

General project rules:
- **DO NOT create documentation automatically** (only when requested)
- **DO NOT create documentation files** without explicit request
- **DO NOT add unnecessary comments** - code should be self-explanatory
- **Comments only to explain "why", not "what"**
- Self-explanatory code through clear naming
- Avoid magic numbers - use named constants
- Keep code clean and maintainable

**Use**: General guidelines for writing clean, self-explanatory code.

### Project-Specific Rules (demo_odbc)

#### 10. `project_dependencies.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`, `pubspec.yaml`

Project-specific dependencies for ODBC access:
- `dart_odbc` - ODBC database access
- `result_dart` - Error handling
- `uuid` - UUID generation
- Database configuration patterns
- SQL command execution patterns
- Transaction management
- Connection pooling
- Safe select builder (avoids binary column errors)

**Use**: This is specific to demo_odbc project for ODBC database access.

#### 11. `project_architecture.mdc`

**Applied to**: `lib/**/*.dart`

Project-specific architecture for DAO pattern:
- DAO pattern with ODBC
- Project structure (dao/ folder organization)
- Core components (config, driver, pool, commands, etc.)
- Data flow
- Patterns used (DAO, Builder, Strategy, Object Pool)
- Best practices for ODBC access
- Extension points

**Use**: This is specific to demo_odbc project architecture.

```

## Creating New Rules

To create a new rule:

1. Create a `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/` folder
2. Add YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Rule description
   globs: ["pattern/**/*.dart"]
   alwaysApply: true
   ---
   ```
3. Add the rule content in Markdown

## Rule Example

```mdc
---
description: Example rule for validation
globs: ["lib/domain/**/*.dart"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Validation Rule

- All entities must validate their data in the constructor
- Value objects must throw specific exceptions for invalid values
- Use cases must validate parameters before executing
```

## Copying Rules to Other Projects

When copying these rules to other projects:

### Keep Generic Rules

These are reusable across any Flutter/Dart project:
- `architecture.mdc` - Clean Architecture overview
- `clean_architecture.mdc` - Dependency rules
- `solid_principles.mdc` - SOLID principles
- `coding_style.mdc` - Dart style guide (2026)
- `coding_conventions.mdc` - Coding conventions
- `null_safety.mdc` - Null safety
- `testing.mdc` - Testing patterns
- `flutter_widgets.mdc` - Flutter widgets
- `general_rules.mdc` - General guidelines

### Replace Project-Specific Rules

Remove or replace project-specific rules:
- `project_dependencies.mdc` - Replace with your project's dependencies
- `project_architecture.mdc` - Replace with your project's architecture

### Customize as Needed

Adjust rules based on:
- Your project's architecture (Clean Architecture, MVVM, etc.)
- Your project's dependencies (state management, routing, etc.)
- Your team's preferences and conventions
- Specific requirements of your domain
